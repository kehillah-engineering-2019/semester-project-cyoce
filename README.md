# Inverted Pendulum Project

The goal of the inverted pendulum project is to create a "pendulum" that pivots from the bottom. The pendulum is then balanced by movin the base to compensate for its fall. The movement of the base would be controlled by a Raspberry Pi with PID feedback control. My initial work so far includes obtaining a camera to provide feedback for movement and a servo to move the base horizontally, and preliminary research on how PID control and OpenCV work.
